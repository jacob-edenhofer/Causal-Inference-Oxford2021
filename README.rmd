# Overview 

This repository contains three substantively important files: 

+ The `general_intro.md` file contains fairly detailed explanations of some of the most commonly used micro-econometric methods. 
  - I introduce these methods by replicating the results of well-known political science papers. This, I hope, is more engaging than providing purely abstract explanations. 

+ All of the datasets I use for replication are saved in the `Data` folder.

+ The `Papers` folder contains the papers discussed in `general_intro.md`. All of these are classics and well worth a read, even if the specific question they examine lies outside your main area of interest.
